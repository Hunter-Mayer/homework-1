# Hunter Mayer Homework Challenge 1 

## Description
In this homework challenge I refractored existing code. I attempted to insure that all links functioned correctly, that the applications CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and followed semantic structure, and that I commented on the changes I made. 

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
